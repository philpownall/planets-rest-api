# planets-rest-api
This server calculates the positions (Right Ascension, Declination, Altitude, and Azimuth) and transit times (Transit, Rise, and Set) of the Sun, Moon, and planets from the observer's longitude and latitude at the current time.

The server can be run standalone as a Node.js app, as a docker server, or as a local Add-On in Home Assistant.
